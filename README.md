## 🔥 What is ThetaBolt?

ThetaBolt is a **quantum-grade agent kernel** engineered to operate without reliance on servers, cloud infra, or data centers. Designed to emulate nature’s own feedback loops — like ATP cycles and resonance fields — ThetaBolt delivers intelligent processing through **signal-based logic** and **modular swarm AI**.

Built for performance. Designed for freedom. Powered by the quantum.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🔋 **Self-sustaining Kernel** – Runs on low-power or even energy-harvested environments (e.g. Raspberry Pi, USB, mesh nodes).
- 🧠 **Agent-in-the-Loop Swarm** – Each node acts as a sovereign AI unit capable of learning, routing, and tasking.
- 🧲 **Signal-Aware Computing** – Kernel adapts to real-world inputs: EMF, sound, temperature, and more.
- 🔐 **AGPL-3.0 Licensed** – Ensures the open-source ecosystem remains strong, ethical, and contributive.
- ⚙️ **Drop-in Ready** – Modular design for seamless use across edge devices, field deployments, and simulations.
