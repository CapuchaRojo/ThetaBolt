refactor: Abstract agent capabilities and specialize task handling

This commit refactors the agent architecture to introduce a more robust and extensible system for task handling.

Key changes:

- **Abstract Base Agent:** The `BaseAgent` is now an abstract class with `handle_task` and `get_capabilities` as abstract methods. This enforces a clear contract for all agent implementations.
- **Specialized Math Agent:** A new `MathAgent` is introduced, which specializes in handling `math_task` types. This demonstrates the new specialized agent model.
- **Capability-based Dispatching:** The `DispatchAgent` now registers agents with their specific capabilities and uses a task queue to dispatch tasks to the most appropriate agent. This allows for more intelligent and efficient task routing.
- **Protocol and Kernel Updates:** The `core/protocols.py` and `src/kernel/kernel_manager.py` files have been updated to support the new agent architecture.
- **Updated Tests:** The test suite has been updated to reflect the new architecture and ensure the system is working as expected.
